By applying text-as-data methods to over 36,000 information requests submitted to the UK central government through the platform Whatdotheyknow.com from 2008 to 2017, I show that requests serve as a valuable indicator of public responsiveness to policies. I demonstrate that citizens use them to bring forward their experiences with new policies, seek more clarification, and voice concerns about policies’ impacts on their lives.
